# goals
> ## Intro

This was just a fun project to see if I could write a workable go cli program in a week!

> ## Documentation

Create new goal: `goals -n`

List all goals: `goals -l`

> ## Limitations

- Currently it only works with a data.json file located in it's working directory
- Can't remove goals without manually dealing with the file
